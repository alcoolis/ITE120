			<h1>Welcome to Super Sports-Naked Bikes</h1>
			<p>Incredible power, spotless handling, brakes that will make
					your nose bleed, no compromises. That's what today's best sport
					motorcycles are all about. Where handling and acceleration are the
					key ingredients to two-wheeled fun, sport motorcycles are the best.
					This class is about speed, thrills, and excitement on the road as
					well as the track.</p>

					<td><p> Also known as "naked" bikes, today's standard-class
					motorcycles are closest to the traditional form: wheels, tank,
					seat, engine. No superfluous equipment. Just the basics. They offer
					the closest thing to an old-school motorcycle experience. Wind in
					the hair, bugs in the teeth. You know, stuff your grandfather went
					on and on about.</p></td>

					<td>In late spring we had a visit with a very fun, creative duo from the CV Collective out of the Comox Valley. The CV Collective is a magazine that covers many areas of the Comox Valley region showcasing local artists, sport, culture and recreation. Jenn Dystra, photographer, and Dave Nowak, writer, have put together a stellar piece about our little shop here on the northern edges of the CV.  The pictures are breath taking, the writing is engaging and thoughtful. Thanks for the visit you 2 !!</td>

					<td>Most standard bikes can be delivered within 12 months of the first payment. Sometimes less and sometimes more. Most repairs or alterations are done much faster than this while special projects can take quite a bit longer. Rush deliveries are possible but can cost you quite a bit extra to cover courier costs and our late nights so we donâ€™t delay our other customers. We may contact you several times in this process to update the progress of your bike and make any necessary changes to the plan. During this time we usually finalize paint choices and arrange for final payment and expected delivery time.</td>
